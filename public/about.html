<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, everyone! I am Zanyar from Kurdistan, 
  Iraq, and I am 22 years old. I would like to share some of my hobbies.
   First and foremost, I am an avid movie enthusiast with a profound passion for watching films.

  Additionally, I am a sports enthusiast. I play football whenever I have the time,
   and although I used to work out, it's not a current practice. Another significant aspect of my life is spending quality time with my family during my free moments.
</p>

<p>
I am a college student, and it is my 5th semester.
I am a Software Engineering student. I have a strong desire to learn coding,
as significant as my passion for watching movies. Currently, 
I am in the foundational stage of learning coding.
I acknowledge that I started a bit late, but in my perspective,
there is no such thing as being too late in life. Every moment is an opportune time to learn. Therefore, I consider myself an 
optimistic person. I am confident that someday I will reach my goal.
